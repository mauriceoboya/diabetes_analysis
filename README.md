## Overview
This is a Django web application that demonstrates the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) for machine learning, to classify diabetes using Pregnancies,Glucose,BloodPressure,SkinThickness,Insulin levels,BMI,DiabetesPedigreeFunction and Age as Features. The project aims to classify data into different classes using SVM, a powerful supervised learning algorithm.

## Features

- User-friendly web interface for uploading and managing datasets
- SVM model training and classification
- Visualization of classification results
- Model evaluation metrics display (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
